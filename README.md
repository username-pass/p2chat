## I will implement encryption soon, but, as of 2023-01-25, it is NOT encrypted

## Features:

Peer to peer communications, no need for a central server. 
Nice UI (To be updated in the future)

## How to use:

1. Open up the HTML file on a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Copy your generated ID
3. Give the ID to the other person using it
4. paste the ID into *their* chat application
5. As soon as you see a message saying it is connected, you may begin chatting!

## TODO:

- add encryption
- add file uploads
- add "friends" system for encryption
- make it more convenient
